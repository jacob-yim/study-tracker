# study-tracker

*Project for HackDavis 2021*

Study Tracker is a Chrome Extension that allows its users to be more focused, productive, and consistent in their work by notifying them about when to take breaks. Notification intervals and break length can be adjusted, whether one prefers a 10-minute break or an hour-long snooze.
