*Project for HackDavis 2021*

Study Tracker is a Chrome extension that reminds studying users to take a short break every hour! Study Tracker also tracks user browser activity, displaying the amount of time spent on each website.

## Features

Study Tracker has two main features: the study timer and the web activity monitor. After an hour, the study timer notifies the user to take a break and begins a 10-minute break timer. After break time is up, the study timer begins again. Users can see how much study or break time is remaining by clicking the Study Tracker extension icon.

The web activity monitor is also viewed using the icon. From here, users can see how much time they spend on the top 5 websites they've visited while Study Tracker is active. Users can view their own web activity to gauge how productive they are while studying.
